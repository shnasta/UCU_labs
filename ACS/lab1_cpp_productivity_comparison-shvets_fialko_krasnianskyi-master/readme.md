# Conclusion

Based on the results presented, we can observe that parsing from strings was generally faster and more memory efficient than parsing from files. Among the methods used to parse from files, Method 4 was the fastest and most memory efficient, with an average execution time of 4092.47 ms and a total heap usage of 76,082,602 bytes allocated. Among the methods used to parse from strings, Method 4 was also the fastest and most memory efficient, with an average execution time of 983.17 ms and a total heap usage of 84,471,206 bytes allocated.

It is also worth noting that there was significant variation in the execution times and total heap usage between the different methods used for parsing, indicating that the efficiency of a parsing method can depend on various factors such as the size of the input data and the format of the input data. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the specific requirements and constraints of a given task when selecting a parsing method.
