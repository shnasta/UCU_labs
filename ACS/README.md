# Computer systems architecture

Here you can find the code for the labs from the Computer systems architecture course.

## Labs
> All the labs are written in C++.
1. Productivity comparison of different ways to read a file and covert double to string and vice versa
2. Calculating the integral of a 3D function by devision of the area into parallelepipeds
3. Calculating the integral with multiple threads
4. Implementing a thread-safe queue and using it for the integral calculation
5. Implementing a thread-pool and using it for the integral calculation
6. Counting the number of words in a large amount of files in zip archives
7. Counting the number of words using our thread-safe queue and thread-pool
8. Counting the number of words using the TBB thread-safe queue and thread-pool
9. Counting the number of words using the TBB parallel_pipeline
10. Two-dimensional heat conduction simulation using MPI for Beowulf cluster
